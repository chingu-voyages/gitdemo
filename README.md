# gitdemo
A repo to be used demoing various git &amp; GitHub features in the **_Chingu Roundtables_**.

This uses a simple Celcius to Fahrenheit conversion to demon-strate how to effectively work in a team with **_git_** and **_GitHub_**.

Isn't this fun!!! It most certainly is! Here comes a merge conflict!
